# Pica-Centro Game

Welcome to **Pica-Centro**, a fun number-guessing game where two players take turns to guess a secret number. The game is inspired by the classic "Pico, Fermi" game, where players have a limited number of guesses to figure out a secret number based on feedback (picas and centros).

## üìú How to Play

1. **Player One**: You will choose a secret number. The number will consist of 3 digits (0-9) and must be kept secret from Player Two.
2. **Player Two**: You will try to guess the secret number. After each guess, Player One will provide feedback:
    - **Pica**: A digit from your guess exists in the secret number, but not in the correct position.
    - **Centro**: A digit from your guess is in the correct position.
3. You have **10 guesses** to figure out the secret number.

## üß† Game Logic

- **Guesses**: Player Two has a total of 10 attempts to guess the secret number.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, Player One provides feedback in terms of picas and centros.
  - **Centro**: A correct digit in the correct position.
  - **Pica**: A correct digit in the wrong position.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **2 Player Game**: Two players interact with the game. Player One provides the secret number, and Player Two guesses it.
- **Input Validation**: The game ensures that only digits (0-9) are entered for the secret number and guesses.
- **ASCII Art**: Fun ASCII art for winning and losing messages to make the game more enjoyable.
